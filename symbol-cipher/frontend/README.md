# Symbol Cipher Tool - Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Symbol Cipher Tool, built with React and Vite.

## Features

- Clean UI with input and output text areas
- Encode and decode buttons for converting text to/from symbols
- Toast notifications for error messages
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Getting Started

To run the frontend in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will proxy API requests to the backend automatically.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
